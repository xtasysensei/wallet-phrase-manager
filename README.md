# Seed phrase manager
This is a project primarily written in **python**.
It aims to help users manage their wallet seed phrases. The Phrases are hashed and stored in a _json_ file which can be unhashed and retrieved at any time. Since it is purely offline, users can manage the _json_ file themselves by making multiple backup(both remote and local). Creating and managing it in a git repo is a very viable method.

## Requirements
- python(version >=3)
- Terminal emulator
It is written to be cross-platform so it works on Windows, MacOS, Linux, FreeBSD and even a Potato.

## Usage
Open a shell, and run:
```bash
git clone 
cd secret-phrase-manager
python3 main.py
```
## GUI
It is mainly a terminal based application but a gui is in development

## Caution
This is a work in progress so use at your own risk

## License
Since it is completely open-source, use it as you please.
